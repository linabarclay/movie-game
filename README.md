## GENERAL

10 questions per round

There ARE repeats! So if you think it's a movie you've already seen, it actually might be.

**Under construction:**

- easy mode
- allow mispelled words

**Typing Rules:**

If you know your answer is right, but it's not saying that it is, check your spelling and these rules to make sure you've typed it in correctly:

- **MOVIES WITH SEQUELS** must specify which movie it is -- can be either number(if it has one) ("star wars episode iv") or title of movie (if it has one) ("star wars a new hope" or "a new hope"). All in one will not be accepted ("star wars episode iv a new hope" would not work).

- **NUMBERS** _are not_ written out ("8" instead of "eight")

- **ACCENTS** and other special characters _are not_ included ("cleo de 5 a 7" instead of "cléo de 5 à 7")

- **DASHES, HYPHENS, and SLASHES** will not be accepted, even if the title has it (type "punch drunk love" instead of "punch-drunk love").
