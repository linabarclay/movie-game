## TYPING RULES:

If you know your answer is right, but it's not saying that it is, check your spelling and these rules to make sure you've types it in correctly:

APOSTROPHES are included ("ocean's 8", NOT "oceans 8")

LANGUAGES: movies titles whose original language is one other than English can be written in either English or the original language -- the same goes for alternate titles

MOVIES WITH SEQUELS must include which movie it is -- can be either number(if it has one) ("star wars episode iv") or title of movie (if it has one) ("star wars a new hope" or "a new hope"). All in one will not be accepted ("star wars episode iv a new hope" would not work).

CAPITALIZATION does not matter. Either of these would be accepted: "CaroL" or "carol"

NUMBERS are not written out ("8" instead of "eight")

COLONS are not included (:)

ABBREVIATIONS do not include periods ("debs" instead of D.E.B.S.)

PERIODS are not included.

COMMAS are not included ("hello my name is doris" instead of "hello, my name is doris")

ACCENTS and other special characters are not included ("cleo de 5 a 7" instead of "cléo de 5 à 7")
