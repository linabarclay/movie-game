## Playing Instructions

**General**

- 10 questions per round
- There ARE repeats! So if you think it's a movie you've already seen, it actually might be.

**Timed Mode**

- Is activated on home screen, can be used for either Cinephile Mode or Easy Mode.
- Timer starts as soon as the mode is selected.

**Decade Selection**

- One or several decades can be selected by clicking on them.
- If you want to play with movies from all decades, you don't have to click all of them -- just select the mode and all decades will be automatically selected.

**Easy Mode**

- Pretty self-explanatory, you click the answer and click submit to move on or if you don't know the answer.
- Note for timed mode: Easy mode best times are different than Cinephile mode best times.

**Cinephile Mode**

- Click reveal answer if you don't know and want to skip the question (this will lower your score).
- Click on the text that says "play again" at end of round to play again.

**Typing Rules:**

If you know your answer is right, but it's not saying that it is, check your spelling and these rules to make sure you've typed it in correctly:

- **MOVIES WITH SEQUELS** must specify which movie it is -- can be either number(if it has one) ("star wars episode iv") or title of movie (if it has one) ("star wars a new hope" or "a new hope").

- **NUMBERS** _are not_ written out ("8" instead of "eight")

- **ACCENTS** and other special characters _are not_ included ("cleo de 5 a 7" instead of "cléo de 5 à 7")

- **DASHES, HYPHENS, and SLASHES** will not be accepted, even if the title has it (type "punch drunk love" instead of "punch-drunk love")
